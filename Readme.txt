Open Sourced game shipped without music.
For this release, I added a bunch of songs thanks to poVoq from github

In the muis folder, you'll also see an executable which you can use to make your own playlist and add songs.
Note that there'a victory/defeat music that that overlays the regular music, but I didn't use it for this release cause I didn't have any good ones to put in
Feel free to add your own!

This release has been compiled, all songs handpicked by myself, Megalex/PowerCat/Olivier G

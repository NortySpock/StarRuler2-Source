Open Sourced game shipped without music.
For this release, I added a bunch of songs thanks to poVoq from github

You can check my github for a playlist generator if you wanna add more songs or add a victory/defeat theme
Note that there's a victory/defeat music that that overlays the regular music, but I didn't use it for this release cause I didn't have any good ones to put in
Feel free to add your own!

This release has been compiled, all songs handpicked by myself, Megalex/PowerCat/Olivier G
